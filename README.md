# FlowPilot 🚀

> An AI-driven, enterprise-grade workflow automation engine built for the modern workforce. 

FlowPilot is a robust web application that leverages Generative AI (Groq API) to instantly architect complex multi-step workflows, dynamically assign them to relevant departments based on roles, and track execution logs—all wrapped in a secure, scalable, and responsive UI.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **AI-Powered Workflow Generation:** Input a single prompt (e.g., "Onboard a new software engineer"), and FlowPilot's AI generates a complete, structured multi-step workflow.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (Draft Mode):** Step-by-step editing interface allows users to modify, add, or delete AI-generated steps before approval.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Strict security ensuring only Admins, Creators, or users with matching departmental roles can execute workflows.
- **Dynamic Email Routing:** Automatically reads the required departments for a workflow and dispatches notification emails to real users assigned to those roles.
- **End-to-End Security:** Passwords hashed with `bcryptjs`, secure JWT-based authentication, fallback secret protection, and API Rate Limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring full Dark Mode support, smooth transitions, and responsive micro-animations.
